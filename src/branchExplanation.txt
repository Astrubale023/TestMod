This branch contain a clean project for a fabric mod.
You just need to change the name of the mod so: the name of the 3 classes(TestMod, TestModClient and TestModDataGeneration),
also you have to change the mod ID, the directory of "src/main/java/net/astrubale/testMod".
After this you have to change the path in the json files and somenthing in gradle files too(maybe).

You can choose to do this weather download a new zip fabric loader from their site: https://fabricmc.net/develop/template/;
